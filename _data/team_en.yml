story: |
    It is primarily a continuous fascination of technology and revolution in the access to the information.
    We met at the university, when we created the University Computer Center during the pioneer Internet and wide area networks period.
    After a few years we moved to one of the most technologically advanced companies in Poland: Advanced Digital Broadcast.
    In ADB we dealt with challenges that faced us and we met many excellent specialists.
    For them and with them for several years we were designing and implementing solutions for infrastructure and IT systems using innovative technologies.
    Together we founded 4clouds.io to pursue our vision of comprehensive services for all who want to use new technologies, getting better quality and spending less.
